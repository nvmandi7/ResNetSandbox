tests
- Test each layer, dimensions
- Learning rate, training mode / eval mode
- Clearing grads
- Testing dataset and manipulation
    - Write tests for: each preprocessing step, windowing
- black formatter or similar

Next steps:
- Set up TrainingSession and config (reading args?)
- Scheduler, transforms
- Go back through "Implementation" section of paper and assure all details met, transforms
- Set up validation and monitoring
- Metablock!
- Script to download dataset?

Questions
- From where to add hooks, keep stateful outputs?
- Mapware: check what was in epoch_end fns


- Argpase for model name, transform name. is eval() okay?
-   Generally understanding how to make clean interface for args
- **Use the class to choose between them
- training on vagabond









---------------------------------


Questions beyond model implementation
- Do you often use ImageFolder or DatasetFolder, or just start from scratch (Dataset) if not using exact classic dataset like CIFAR10 or ImageNet
- Why does ImageFolder work even though my directory structure is different from the documentation

- Where to put code for train/valid/test loops. Learn a good extensible strategy here
- Eval vs validation. How did they do validation for ResNet (50k images), at what part of the loop?


- Organizing the code well such that itâ€™s easy to find functionality and know where to put it. (Adding to path?)
- Behind the scenes on torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder and DatasetFolder within ImageNet and others.
    - Pytorch design decision, inheritance but with methods loose in files instead of on classes, pros/cons?
- If we design this repo for multiple models, multiple datasets (adding CIFAR and EfficientNet/ConvNeXt), how to organize it. One TrainingSession, Trainer. Configs for seeting hparams, transforms, metrics?
- Dataloader: examples I see don't reimplement it. Where do we run the transforms, and to we have any other custom code?
- Recommendation for downloading ImageNet
- Organization choices for grouping transforms. Should we put the transforms in separate classes? 


-----------------------

Next phases
- Full project: Set up Dataset, Dataloader, training loop, monitoring, eval
- MetaBlocks!! :)
- New models: build up to ConvNeXt
- Personal project: BirdVAE??



Questions on ResNet:
- Do we really just average all 7x7 into 1? Is that not wasteful of our rich semantic features?
- How do we decide which layers have bias term?
- Python style Q: how to leave variable in interface as mandatory to implement
- Q: How to reshape in a sequential?
- Look at model summary for resnet18 and 50
- TODO: bias=False on layers before BatchNorm
